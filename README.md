# ANOMALY_DETECTION
This project uses the pytorch framework and Autoencoder Architecture to predict the anomalies 

It extensively uses the pytorch for improving the model's performance efficiently, 
Autoencoder's architecture is used since it is one of the best architecure for anomaly detection tasks
